# Step 1: Print Hello World in console with "source <file-name>" or creating a script "filename.sh" and execute with "bash <file-name> and save in that file the next sentence:

echo "Hello World"

* Or print in console with "echo "Hello World"


# Step 2: Create new folder named new_dir.
* first option - Inside folder:
mkdir new_dir 
* second option - Outside folder:
mkdir /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/new_dir 
* or
mkdir ~/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/new_dir 


# Step 3: Delete new_dir folder.
* First option - Inside folder:
rm -rf new_dir
* second option - Outside folder:
rm -rf /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/new_dir


# Step 4: Make a copy of sed.txt (located in the lorem folder) to lorem-copy.
* first option - inside folder:
cp sed.txt /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy/sed.txt
* second option - outside folder:
cp /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem/sed.txt /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy/sed.txt


# Step 5: Copy the rest of the files located in lorem to lorem-copy using only one code line (tip: use ;).
* using pipe you can concatenate commands, insight the folder "lorem"
ls -ltrah | grep -v 'sed.txt' | cp * /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy/


# Step 6: Locate at lorem folder and show sed.txt content.
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem 
more sed.txt


# Step 7: Locate at lorem folder and show at.txt and lorem.txt content.
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem 
cat at.txt
cat lorem.txt


# Step 8: Locate at lorem-copy folder and show the first three lines of sed.txt.
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy
head -n 3 sed.txt


# Step 9: Locate at lorem-copy folder and show the last three lines of sed.txt.
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy
tail -n 3 sed.txt


# Step 10: Add Homo homini lupus. at the end of sed.txt located at lorem-copy.
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy
gedit sed.txt
# scroll down at the bottom and add "Homo homini lupus", then press save and quit. (this method was applyed with Linux Editor)


# Step 11: Locate at lorem-copy folder and show the last three lines of sed.txt. Now you should see Homo homini lupus..
cd /home/jfh/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy
tail -n 3 sed.txt


# Step 12: Change every et to ET in at.txt located at lorem-copy (tip: use sed).
sed -i 's/et/ET/g' at.txt

# Step 13: Find the active user of the system.
who


# Step 14: Find out where are you located within the system.
pwd


# Step 15: List all .txt files located at lorem
ls -l  ~/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem/*.txt


# Step 16: Count the number of lines in sed.txt located at lorem.
cd ~/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem
wc -l sed.txt


# Step 17: Count the number of files which name starts with lorem located at the whole lab directory.
find ~/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420 -name 'lorem*' | wc -l


# Step 18: Count the number of times et appears in at.txt located at lorem.
grep -oi 'et' at.txt | wc -l


# Step 19: Count the number of times the string et appears in at.txt located at lorem.
grep -oiw 'et' at.txt | wc -l


# Step 20: Count the number of times the string et appears in every file located at lorem-copy.
grep -rwo 'et' ~/Ironhack/IronLabs/dataptmad0420/extra-work/m1/lab-bash-master/lorem-copy/ | wc -l
